# 02 - Typography & Colors

This mini project explores the use of typography and color in frontend development.  
The goal is to build a clean and readable user profile card using only basic HTML and CSS.

### ðŸ“Œ What I Practiced:
- Importing and applying custom font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- Using font size, weight, and spacing to create clear text hierarchy
- Styling basic layout without Flexbox or Grid
- Working with buttons, hover effects, and basic visual contrast

All code is written manually as part of my self-directed learning journey.  
This exercise helps strengthen my understanding of CSS fundamentals before moving to layout systems like Flexbox.
