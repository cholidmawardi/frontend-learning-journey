## 🧱 Topics Covered

- **Box Model**  
  Understanding content, padding, border, and margin — the visual boundaries of every element.

  Applying visual hierarchy through text styling and color schemes.

- **Layout, Padding, Margin**  
  Arranging elements with consistent spacing using margin and padding.

## 📌 Learning Outcomes

- Gain mastery over spacing and alignment using the Box Model.
- Build clear and accessible designs with proper font and color usage.
- Apply real layout strategies that set a strong foundation for responsive design.

## 💡 Reflection

> “Mastering layout with margin and padding is more impactful than writing clever JavaScript —  
> because if the structure is broken, nothing else matters.”

This foundation ensures I don’t just “style” a page, but understand how to **compose** it like a professional.
