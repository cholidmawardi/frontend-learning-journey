# 03 - Layout: Padding & Margin

This project is a self-defined exercise focusing on layout and spacing using only padding, margin, and width â€” without Flexbox or Grid.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- Practice clean layout using the CSS box model
- Use `box-sizing: border-box` for accurate spacing control
- Center a card using `margin: 0 auto`
- Apply consistent 8px spacing between internal sections

All styling and structure follow a personally set goal, designed to reinforce spacing fundamentals before learning modern layout systems.

> No Flexbox, no frameworks â€” just solid fundamentals and self-discipline.
