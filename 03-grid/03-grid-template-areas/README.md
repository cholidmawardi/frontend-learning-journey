# 03. Grid Template Areas

This project demonstrates the use of the `grid-template-areas` property to create a semantic and readable layout structure using CSS Grid.

## ðŸ§© What I Built

A basic layout that includes the following sections:

- `header`
- `nav`
- `main`
- `sidebar`
- `footer`

These areas are defined using `grid-template-areas`, making the layout visually descriptive in both code and structure. Each area is styled with minimal colors to differentiate its role on the page.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

- Learn how to use `grid-template-areas` to visually organize a layout.
- Understand the role of named grid areas in improving code readability.
- Practice assigning `grid-area` to children elements.
- Explore how `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` interact with area placement.

## ðŸš€ Outcome

This exercise lays the foundation for more complex grid-based layouts like **admin dashboards**, **portfolio landing pages**, or **content-heavy web apps**.  
It also strengthens the ability to write maintainable and scalable CSS Grid systems.
