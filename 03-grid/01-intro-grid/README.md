# 01 - Intro to CSS Grid

This is a basic layout structure built using **CSS Grid**, as an introduction to the grid system.

The layout consists of four sections:

- **Header** at the top
- **Sidebar** on the left
- **Main content** on the right
- **Footer** at the bottom

The layout is defined using `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` to position items properly in a two-dimensional space.
