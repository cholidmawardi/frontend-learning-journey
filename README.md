## 📘 About This Project

This repository documents my personal learning path in frontend development. 
Every folder represents a key topic I've studied, with focused practice, real application, and clear structure.
All code in this repository is written manually based on actual understanding. I do not copy-paste code blindly — everything is typed, tested, and refined through real practice.

> I believe mastering the fundamentals — such as the **Box Model**, **Typography**, **Flexbox**, and **Grid** — is more important than jumping straight into frameworks.  
> This journey is not just about completing tasks, but building long-term understanding and **clean, scalable code**.
