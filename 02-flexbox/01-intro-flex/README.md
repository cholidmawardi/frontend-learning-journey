# 01 - Intro to Flexbox

This project is the first practical exercise for mastering **Flexbox layout**.  
The initial version focused on positioning using `display: flex`, while the latest update adds better UI/UX through colors, spacing, custom branding, and semantic layout.

---

### 🧠 What I Practiced

- `display: flex`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`
- Building horizontal and vertical layouts using Flexbox
- Semantic class naming and modular structure
- UI styling with color, padding, spacing, and hierarchy
- Custom logo implementation via `/assets/logo.png`
- Applying Google Fonts (`Inter`) and smooth hover effects

---

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5 (semantic structure)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, box model, spacing)
- Google Fonts (`Inter`)
- Image assets (`logo.png`)
- No JavaScript, no frameworks

---

## 📱 Responsive Update

This version includes responsive enhancements to the `intro-flex` layout:

- Navigation now adapts to small screens
- Logo size adjusts based on viewport width
- Layout remains proportional and readable under 400px
- Simplified navigation by removing redundant "Home" link

> Focused on real-world Flexbox use with minimal CSS — no media queries frameworks or JavaScript involved.
