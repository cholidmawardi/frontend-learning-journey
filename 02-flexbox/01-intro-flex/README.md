# 01 - Intro to Flexbox

This project is the first hands-on exercise for learning Flexbox.  
It focuses on using `display: flex` to create a basic layout with horizontal and vertical alignment.

### ✅ What I Practiced
- Flex container and items
- `justify-content` for horizontal spacing
- `align-items` for vertical alignment
- Semantic class naming and layout structuring

This version contains the **core layout structure only**, without styling or color —  
to emphasize understanding of **positioning and hierarchy using Flexbox**.

More styling and enhancements will be added in the next commits.
