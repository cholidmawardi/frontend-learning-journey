# 04 - Flex Wrap (Basic)

This project demonstrates how to use `flex-wrap` to make a layout responsive with flexible cards.

## 🔍 Features

- Responsive layout using Flexbox
- `flex: 1 1 250px` ensures each card can grow or shrink based on available space
- `flex-wrap: wrap` automatically moves cards to the next line on smaller screens
- Clean spacing using `gap` property
- Minimal styling with soft shadows and rounded corners

## 💡 Notes

No media queries are needed in this basic version — the layout is naturally responsive because of the `wrap` behavior.
