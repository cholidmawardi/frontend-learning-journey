# 03 - Flexbox Alignment

A basic project to demonstrate how to align elements using Flexbox.  
This exercise focuses on **vertical centering** using `flex-direction: column`, `justify-content: center`, and `align-items: center`.

---

## 📐 Techniques Used

- `display: flex`
- `flex-direction: column`
- `justify-content: center`
- `align-items: center`
- `gap` for spacing between elements
- `height: 100vh` to simulate hero-section behavior

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To understand how Flexbox handles alignment both **horizontally** and **vertically**, especially for stacking and centering blocks inside a container.
