# 02 - Flex Grow & Shrink (Responsive Version)

This project demonstrates how `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` work to build flexible and adaptive layouts using Flexbox.

Originally a basic layout, it has been **improved** to handle different screen sizes using **media queries** and better spacing.

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to use the `flex` shorthand (`grow`, `shrink`, `basis`)
- How to control how flex items expand and shrink
- How to build a layout that **responds to viewport size**
- How to use `gap` to space out elements cleanly
- How to apply **media queries** to shift from horizontal to vertical layout

## 📱 Responsive Layout

- **Large screens**: Horizontal layout with varied flex-grow/shrink ratios
- **Small screens**: Stacked vertical layout using media queries
- Smooth spacing and clean content flow
