            <h2>Feature A - Grow 2</h2>
            <p>The <strong>flex-grow: 2</strong> property allows this box to take twice the extra space compared to others when there is free room in the container.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature feature-b">
            <h2>Feature B - Balanced</h2>
            <p>This box uses <strong>flex: 1 1 150px</strong> which means it grows and shrinks at normal rate and starts from a base of 150px.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature feature-c">
            <h2>Feature C - Shrink Faster</h2>
            <p>With <strong>flex-shrink: 2</strong>, this box will shrink twice as fast when there's not enough space. It helps prioritize other boxes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature feature-d">
            <h2>Feature D - Smallest</h2>
            <p>This box starts from <strong>50px flex-basis</strong> and has <strong>flex-shrink: 3</strong>, so it gets squeezed first on small screens.</p>
